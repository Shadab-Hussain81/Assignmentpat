    "Ans Variable Names:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variable names must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n",
    "The first character can be followed by letters, underscores, or digits (0-9).\n",
    "Python is case-sensitive, so variables named \"myVar\" and \"myvar\" are considered different.\n",
    "Avoid using reserved words or built-in function names as variable names.\n",
    "Assigning Values:\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are created when you assign a value to them using the assignment operator (=).\n",
    "The value assigned can be of any data type, such as numbers, strings, lists, etc.\n",
    "Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable.\n",
    "The data type is inferred based on the value assigned to the variable.\n",
    "You can reassign a variable to a value of a different data type without any issues.\n",
    "Naming Conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "It's good practice to follow certain naming conventions to make your code more readable.\n",
    "Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words in variable names (e.g., my_variable).\n",

    "Ans  Variable Names: Use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the purpose or content of the variable. Avoid single-letter variable names (except for simple loop counters). For example, use \"total_students\" instead of \"ts\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Case Styles:\n",
    "\n",
    "Use lowercase letters for variable names, except for constants, which should be in uppercase. For example, use \"count\" or \"student_name\", but \"MAX_VALUE\".\n",
    "For multi-word variable names, separate words with underscores (\"snake_case\"). For example, use \"first_name\" or \"total_count\".\n",
    "Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use Python reserved words (keywords) as variable names. For example, avoid using \"if\", \"for\", \"while\", etc., as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function and Method Names: Follow the same conventions as variable names (descriptive, lowercase, snake_case). Use verbs or verb phrases to describe actions. For example, use \"calculate_total\" or \"get_student_name\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Class Names: Use the CapWords convention (also known as CamelCase) for class names, where the first letter of each word is capitalized. For example, use \"MyClass\" or \"PersonInfo\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Constants: Constants are usually defined at the module level and should be named in uppercase with underscores separating words. For example, use \"PI\" or \"MAX_ATTEMPTS\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Private Variables: By convention, variables that are intended to be private (not intended for use outside of the class) should start with a single underscore. For example, \"_private_variable\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Avoid Ambiguous Names: Choose variable names that are not easily confused with each other. For instance, using \"l\" (lowercase L) as a variable name can be mistaken for \"1\" (the number one) in some fonts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indentation and Line Length: Maintain consistent indentation using spaces (typically four spaces). Limit your lines to a maximum of 79 characters for improved readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation: Use comments and docstrings to provide explanations and document the purpose, usage, and behavior of variables."
